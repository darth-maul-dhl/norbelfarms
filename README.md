Norbel Farms is a chatbot designed to assist farmers with custom tillage recommendations. Farmers can provide details like farm location, equipment inventory, and anticipated tilling date through text, voice, or image input. Powered by real-time weather information from OpenWeatherMap, Norbel Farms offers actionable recommendations for optimal tilling, including expected costs, tilling duration, and required equipment. This information is further enhanced with an interactive 3D visualization, showing a satellite view of the farm (via the Google Maps API) with 3D models of the required farming equipment.
